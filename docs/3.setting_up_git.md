# <h1 align="center">3. Setting up Git</h1>


When we use Git on a new computer for the first time, we need to configure a few things. Below are a few examples of configurations we will set as we get started with Git:

* our name and email address,
* what our preferred text editor is,
* and that we want to use these settings globally (i.e. for every project).


On a command line, Git commands are written as `git verb options`, where `verb` is what we actually want to do and `options` is additional optional information which may be needed for the `verb`.

    Following user name and email will be associated with your subsequent Git activity, which means that any changes pushed to GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab or another Git host server after this lesson will include this information.

    For this lesson, we will be interacting with GitHub and so the email address used **should be the same** as the [one used when setting up your GitHub account](https://kir-rescomp.github.io/training-intro-to-git-github/#multi-factor-authentication). If you are concerned about privacy, please review GitHub’s instructions for keeping your email address private.

    ```bash
    $ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    $ git config --global user.email "Email address"
    ```

        If you elect to use a private email address with GitHub, then use GitHub’s no-reply email address for the user.email value. It looks like ID+username@users.noreply.github.com. You can look up your own address in your [GitHub email settings](https://github.com/settings/emails).

        Always remember that if you forget the subcommands or options of a `git` command, you can access the relevant list of options typing `git <command> -h` or access the corresponding Git manual by typing `git <command> --help`, e.g.:

        ```bash
        $ git config -h 
        $ git config --help
        ```
