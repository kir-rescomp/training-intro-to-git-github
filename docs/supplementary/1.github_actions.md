# GitHub Actions — Automated Testing

Dr. X wants to ensure changes don't break the pipeline. They set up **GitHub Actions** to automatically test every commit.

### `.github/workflows/test.yml`:
````yaml
name: Test Pipeline

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.9'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          pytest tests/
````

Now, every push and PR triggers automated tests. If tests fail, the PR shows a ❌ and won't be merged until fixed.
