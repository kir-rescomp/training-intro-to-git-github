# Forking — External Contributions

A postdoc from another university wants to adapt `CellClusterFlow` for their spatial transcriptomics data. They can't push directly (no write access), so they **fork** the repository.

### Forking workflow:

1. **Fork**: Click "Fork" on GitHub → creates copy under their account
2. **Clone their fork**:
````bash
   git clone https://github.com/PostdocZ/CellClusterFlow.git
````
3. **Make changes** on a new branch
4. **Push to their fork**
5. **Open a Pull Request** from their fork back to Dr. X's original repo

This is how **open-source** contributions work — anyone can suggest improvements without needing direct access!
