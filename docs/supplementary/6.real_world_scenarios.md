# Real-World Research Scenarios

### 🔬 Scenario 1: Publishing alongside a paper
````bash
# Make repository public before paper submission
# Tag the version used in the paper
git tag -a v1.0-paper -m "Code for Smith et al. 2025"
git push origin v1.0-paper

# Add DOI from Zenodo for citability
````

### 🤝 Scenario 2: Multi-lab collaboration
````bash
# Add collaborator's fork as remote
git remote add collaborator https://github.com/CollabLab/CellClusterFlow.git

# Fetch their branches
git fetch collaborator

# Review their work
git checkout collaborator/new-algorithm
````

### 📚 Scenario 3: Archiving for reproducibility
- Link GitHub repo in paper's Data Availability section
- Use Zenodo integration for permanent DOI
- Include `environment.yml` or `requirements.txt` for exact dependencies
