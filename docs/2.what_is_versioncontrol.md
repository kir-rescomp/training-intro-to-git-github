## What is Version Control ?

Version control can be used to keep track of versions of a piece of work that either a single person is working on, or a shared document. It is designed to avoid a situation like the one noted below.

    ```bash
    mydocument.txt
    mydocument_v2.txt
    mydocument_v3_rev-BHP.txt
    mydocument_v8_Final?.txt
    ```
Some tools let us deal with this a bit better without creating a brand new file for every “save”. For example, using Microsoft Word’s “Track Changes” allows us to highlight the changes that are being made within the document. This can be helpful for when collaborating on a document so other people can see the changes being made. Alternatively, DropBox and Google Docs have a built-in “version history” feature which keeps older versions of documents (up to a certain point in time) so that you can revert back to if need be.

**Version control systems** on the other hand start with a base version of the document and then **save only the changes you made at each step** of the way by taking a so-called “snapshot”. A snapshot records information about when a file was saved, and all the differences between the current document and the previous version. The user (you) decides when these snapshots are collected, and this allows one to ‘rewind’ your file to an older version
