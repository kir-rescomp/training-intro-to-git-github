<h2 align="center">Version Control for Cell Clusters — A Git Journey in the Lab</h2>

Dr. Lin is a computational biologist working on a new single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) pipeline.
Like most data scientists, their workflow involves constant tweaking: preprocessing, quality control, normalization, clustering, and visualization.

They are tired of lost scripts, mysterious file versions like `clustering_final_FINAL.R`, and overwritten notebooks.

So, they decided to version-control their pipeline properly using **Git**

1. `git init` - Starting a new experiment 

They begin their project as they would a new experiment — setting up a clean workspace.

!!! terminal ""

    ```bash
    mkdir CellCulsterFlow
    cd CellClusterFlow
    ```
    
    ```bash
    git init
    ```
This initialises an empty Git repository, like labeling an empty freezer box before adding samples.
Every change from here on will be tracked.
